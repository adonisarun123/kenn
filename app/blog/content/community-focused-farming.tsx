    <p class="text-xl text-primary-sage leading-relaxed mb-8">
      As urban challenges mount and environmental concerns grow, a revolutionary approach to agriculture is emerging. At Kenn EcoEstates, we're pioneering a community-focused farming model that combines sustainable practices with collective wellness, setting new standards for the future of agriculture.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">The Evolution of Agriculture</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-primary-sage leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Traditional farming has often been a solitary pursuit, with individual farmers facing challenges alone. However, our 30+-acre wellness community demonstrates how collective farming can transform both agriculture and community living.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-primary-mist rounded-3xl p-8 mb-8">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-4">Key Community Benefits</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-3 text-primary-sage">
        <li>• Shared knowledge and expertise</li>
        <li>• Collective resource management</li>
        <li>• Sustainable infrastructure</li>
        <li>• Democratic decision-making</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">The Power of Collective Knowledge</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-primary-sage leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Within our community of 100 families, knowledge sharing becomes a powerful tool. Experienced gardeners mentor newcomers, while technology professionals contribute innovative solutions to farming challenges. This exchange creates a dynamic learning environment that benefits everyone.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">Sustainable Infrastructure Development</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-primary-sage leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Our community approach allows for the development of sustainable infrastructure that would be impractical for individual farmers. From rainwater harvesting systems to organic waste management, we're creating efficient, environmentally conscious solutions.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-gradient-to-r from-primary-green to-primary-clay rounded-3xl p-8 text-primary-white mb-8">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold mb-4">Sustainable Features</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-3">
        <li>• Advanced irrigation systems</li>
        <li>• Organic composting facilities</li>
        <li>• Renewable energy integration</li>
        <li>• Natural pest management</li>
      </ul>
    </div>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">Democratic Governance in Agriculture</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-primary-sage leading-relaxed mb-8">
      With 0.5% voting rights per plot owner, our community ensures that agricultural decisions are made collectively. This democratic approach leads to better resource allocation and more sustainable farming practices.
    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">The Wellness Connection</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-primary-sage leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Our farming practices are intrinsically linked to wellness. From organic growing methods to the therapeutic benefits of gardening, every aspect of our agricultural approach supports holistic health.
    </p>

    <div class="bg-primary-mist rounded-3xl p-8 mb-8">
      <h3 class="text-2xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-4">Wellness Benefits</h3>
      <ul class="space-y-3 text-primary-sage">
        <li>• Access to fresh, organic produce</li>

        <li>• Mental wellness from nature connection</li>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">Resource Optimization</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-primary-sage leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Community farming allows for efficient resource sharing. From equipment to bulk purchasing of supplies, collective ownership reduces individual costs while maximizing sustainability.
    </p>

    <p class="text-lg text-primary-sage leading-relaxed mb-8">

    </p>

    <h2 class="text-3xl font-bold text-primary-black mb-6">Environmental Impact</h2>
    <p class="text-lg text-primary-sage leading-relaxed mb-8">
      Community-focused farming significantly reduces environmental impact through shared resources, sustainable practices, and collective environmental stewardship.
    </p>
